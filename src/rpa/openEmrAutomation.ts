// This module previously contained a nut.js-based automation prototype.
// With the adoption of showlab/computer_use_ootb as the RPA layer, EMR
// automation is now handled entirely via HTTP in `/api/emr-snapshot`.
//
// The file is kept as a placeholder to document that no direct desktop
// bindings are required inside the Next.js runtime anymore.
